# Booking Table App
This is a project developed with React for the Meta Fullstack Developer course. The application allows users to book a table at a restaurant by selecting the date, time, number of people, and other relevant information for the reservation.

## Technologies Used
React.js - JavaScript library for building user interfaces

React Hooks - For state and side effect management

CSS - For styling the application

Testing Library - For testing component behavior

GitHub Pages - For deploying the application to a static domain

## Main Features
Table Booking: Users can select the date, time, and number of people to book a table.

Time Update: Available times are automatically updated based on the selected date.

Booking Form: The user enters details such as name, phone number, email, and additional notes to complete the reservation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
